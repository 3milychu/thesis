It is built as a single page application (SPA) with three states. Each state visually experiments with binding data to an element of embodied experience: 1) situatedness, 2) activity and 3) perception. It is the belief of this project that while digital artifacts cannot currently replace the richness of lived experience, we can strategically implement tested methodologies with documented effects which humanize temporal data digitally, bringing information to life by embodying it in experienced time. This approach to data visualization is referred to as designing in Kairos.\n\n## Credits\n**Design, Engineering and Data Visualization** Emily Chu<br>\n**Thesis Instructor** Daniel Sauter, Associate Professor of Data Visualization, Parsons School of Design<br>\n**Mentor** Aaron Hill, MS Data Visualization Program Director, Parsons School of Design<br>\n\n**Data sources graciously provided from proprietary research conducted by:**<br>\nMichael Schober, Professor of Psychology at the New School for Social Research and Associate Provost for Research\nNeta Spiro, Research Fellow in Performance Science at the Royal College of Music and an honorary Research Fellow at Imperial College London.\n\n**Music**<br>\nFantasiest端cke, Op.73 (Schumann, Robert)<br>\nThree Fantasy Pieces (Drei Fantasiest端cke) for clarinet and piano, Op. 73, were written in 1849 by Robert Schumann.
