## Project Abstract
Notes on Perspective is a data visualization that invites the audience to witness insights from a classical music recital critique in embodied time. It is built as a single page application (SPA) with three states. Each state visually experiments with binding data to an element of embodied experience: 1) situatedness, 2) activity and 3) perception. It is the belief of this project that while digital artifacts cannot currently replace the richness of lived experience, we can strategically implement tested methodologies with documented effects which humanize temporal data digitally, bringing information to life by embodying it in experienced time. This approach to data visualization is referred to as designing in Kairos.
