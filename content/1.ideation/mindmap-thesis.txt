I am visualizing representations of temporality because I want to understand what patterns can be revealed and how memory is affected when you redesign time for the digital medium (interactivity, materializing)
Time and Memory
History of events
Living or dead history
Narrative time
master narratives
meta-narratives
Remembering time
patterns
re-mining time
the particular
landmarks
collections of memories
Identities over time
Creation of identities
Fragmenting identities
Destruction of identities
Maintenance of identity
Representing the quantified self over time
Data self over time
times when behaviors occur
amplification of behaviors
policing
curation
collections
Perception of Time
Experience of Time
Representation of duration
real-time
recorded time
spatialization of time
Digital explorations i.e. "if an hour was a pixel..."
Interaction with time
dialogue with time
annotated time
Making time physical; "playing with time"
materializing time as data
"digging" in time
past, present, future moments of time colliding
artifacts of time
qualities of artifacts of time
aging
texture
process
transformations
fusion
actions
birth
form
death
opacity
games/simulations
replaying/rewinding
pausing time
reversing time (effects)
direction of time
linear
top/bottom
forward/backward
left/right
simultaneous
stream
past/present/future collide and influence
Passing of time
losing/devouring time
fading of time; irretrievability
temporary nature of time
"vanishing" fringe
Division of time
Units of time
creation of alternative units of time?
Use of time
Labor and productivity
reactions against time
reimagining the sense of time
Synchronization
collaboration
Value of time
Repetition over time
connection or break with the future
Cyclical time
Relations to time
relation between humans and their natural environment
Personal units of time?
Audience
Design researchers
Journalists
Data artists
Data scientists
General practitioners with data
Data
Cultural data
Image data
Ecological data
Narrative data
Time-series data
Self-tracking data
Real-time news
Questions
How can alternative views of temporality for datasets with images and rich metadata impact the discovery of relationships among objects and events across time?
How can alternate views of temporality impact understanding of rhythm inherent to natural ecologies to reduce environmental carelessness?
How does varying the temporal design of data narratives impact individual memory, collective memory, shared memory?
What other units of time might be imagined to better understand progression of events or behaviors over time?
Organization of Time
Representations of time
clocks
calendars
timelines
time-series
photographic narrative
video narrative
literature narrative
Relative time
Dependent on the reference body/subject's frame of reference
time experiences of different observers varies
Dependent on time, space, circumstance
Time inseparable from lived experience
Process of being
space-time continuum
events happen simultaneously
"pure" time
Newtonian Time
Sequential time
Absolute time
Calendar time
Chronometrical time
Universal time
Time abstracted from events and nature
"measurable" time
