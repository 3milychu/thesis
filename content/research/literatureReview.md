Temporality - dividing time<br>
Questions:<br>
-- perceptions of time
-- comparing times
-- experience of time
-- events in time
-- refiguring time?

### Philosophies of time 
• Zeno: infinite divisibility of movement into units of time<br>
• Aristotle: system of temporal modes (real, possible necessary) where material -- the real-- through form becomes actualized<br>
 -- transition from potential to reality constitutes movement<br>
• Newtonian Time: empty container filling with events<br>
• Einstein spacetime: space and time are bound within each other; relative based on 'place, speed, mode of comparison'<br>
-- Every reference body has its own particular time<br>
