Temporality - dividing time
Questions:
-- perceptions of time
-- comparing times
-- experience of time
-- events in time
-- refiguring time?

### Philosophies of time 
• Zeno: infinite divisibility of movement into units of time
• Aristotle: system of temporal modes (real, possible necessary) where material -- the real-- through form becomes actualized 
 -- transition from potential to reality constitutes movement
• Newtonian Time: empty container filling with events
• Einstein spacetime: space and time are bound within each other; relative based on 'place, speed, mode of comparison'
-- Every reference body has its own particular time
