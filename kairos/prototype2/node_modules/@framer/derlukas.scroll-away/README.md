# Overview

Scroll Away hides design elements on scrolling down and let's them reappear on scrolling up.

## (Temporary) Setup

Since Framer X currently doesn't allow to use the code overrides that come with a package, here's the temporary workaround to get this component to work in the meantime:

1. **Install** this package.
2. In the **components panel**, right-click the component and select "**Copy Code**".
3. **Create** a new code component, call it "**ScrollAway**" and paste the previously copied code.
4. Go back to the Store, go to "Installed"-Tab and uninstall the **ScrollAway** package.

Now you can follow the steps below to get it to work.

## Usage

1. Drag the component onto the canvas.
2. Connect to the Frame you want to use as content.
3. Apply code override "**scrollComponent**" to the scroll-component it should listen to.
4. Apply code override **getData** to the **ScrollAway** component.
5. Adjust the **settings** of the **ScrollAway**-component to your needs.
