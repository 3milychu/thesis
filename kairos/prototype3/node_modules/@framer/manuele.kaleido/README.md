# Kaleido

Kaleido is a canvas playground to experiment with visual repetition, random displacement and happy accidents.

You start loading your graphic elements (SVGs yeld better results) and the component provides you full control on number of rows and columns, and variations of elements' size, rotation, paddings, horizontal and vertical displacement, and so on.

Change the "seed" to change the randomization, or keep it fixed if you like the particular effect you got.

#### Next Iterations:

- Circular displacement
- Displacement animation
- Control on refresh opacity
